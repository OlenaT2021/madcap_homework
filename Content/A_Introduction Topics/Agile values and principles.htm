        <p>The<b> <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Agile glossary.Term2">Agile Manifesto</MadCap:glossaryTerm></b> is a set of foundational principles for agile software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It Outlines<b> <a href="#four_" target="_self">4 core Values</a></b> and <b><a href="#12_principles">12 Principles</a></b> guide agile practices.</p>
        <p>The <b>Agile Manifesto</b> is a document that outlines a set of guiding principles for adaptive and customer-centric software development. This manifesto was officially released on February 13, 2001. This has marked a turning point in the industry, with Agile methodologies gaining attraction globally.</p>
        <p>It was created by a group of software development personnel and  outlines <strong><a name="four_"></a>four </strong>key concepts that encourage lightweight development. The <b>main key values</b> are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <cite>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</cite>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.All users">The Agile Manifesto and the 12 Principles were written by a group of software developers (and a tester) to address issues that software developers faced. When you think of Agile as a mindset, that mindset can be applied to other activities</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>Let’s take a look at each one in detail:</p>
        <table style="mc-table-style: url('../Resources/TableStyles/NewStyle_default.css');margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;" class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default" cellspacing="0">

                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-Body-Body1">
                    <td class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-BodyE-Column1-Body1" style="text-align: center;"> <b>Individuals and interactions</b></td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-BodyD-Column1-Body1" style="text-align: left;">
                        <p style="text-align: left;">In the past, a lot of software teams would concentrate on having the best possible tools or processes with which to build their software. The Agile Manifesto suggests that while those things are important, the people behind the processes are even more so.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">Having the right group of individuals on your software team is vital to success. The best possible tools in the wrong hands are worthless. Perhaps even more important is how these individuals communicate with each other. The interactions between team members are what helps them to collaborate and solve any problems that arise.</p>

                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-Body-Body2">
                    <td class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-BodyE-Column1-Body2" style="text-align: center;">
                        <b>Working software</b>

                    <td class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-BodyD-Column1-Body2" style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>Previously, software developers would spend ages creating detailed documentation. That was before they even started writing a single line of code. And while documentation isn’t a bad thing, there comes a point when you should focus on providing your customers with working software. </p>
                        <p>The Agile Manifesto places shipping software to your customers as one of the highest priorities. You can then gather feedback to help you improve future releases.</p>

                        <b> Customer collaboration</b>
                    </td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-BodyD-Column1-Body1" style="text-align: left;">
                        <p> Once upon a time, contracts were king. You would draw up contracts with your customers who would then detail the finished product. As a result, there was often a contrast between what the contract said, what the product did, and what the customer actually required. </p>
                        <p>According to the Agile Manifesto, the focus should be on continuous development. You need to build a feedback loop with your customers so that you can constantly ensure that your product works for them</p>

                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-Body-Body2">
                    <td class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-BodyB-Column1-Body2" style="text-align: center;">
                        <b>Responding to change</b>
                    </td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-NewStyle_default-BodyA-Column1-Body2" style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>Can you imagine a time where you would draw up a roadmap and it would never change? Well, in the past that’s exactly what happened. The trouble with static roadmaps is that we don’t live in a static world. Needs and requirements are always shifting, and priorities are always changing. That static roadmap will soon grow outdated. </p>
                        <p>That’s why the Agile Manifesto suggests that a software team should have the ability to pivot and change direction whenever they need to, with a flexible roadmap that reflects that. A dynamic roadmap can change from quarter to quarter, sometimes even month to month, and agile teams are able to keep up with those changes.</p>

        <p>Implementing the 12 principles of Agile will help you build an Agile organization that can help you with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Be more flexible so you can adapt to emerging changes in the process</p>

            <li>
                <p>Focus on early value delivery in order to get quick feedback from the market but also realize a faster ROI of your product/service</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a healthy working environment where everybody feels appreciated and thus better contributes to meeting customer’s requirements</p>
